#### 28 Introduction to WebGL and GPU rendering with Three.js **Patrick FÃ¼rst**


* Why to learn [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) ? 
    - Thanks to WebGL the technology for 3D programs is made widely available in the web browser. This new technology let's us create new immersive user experiences, by creating [3D games](http://kiddisco.asmallgame.com/), [interactive videos](http://www.ro.me/) and many [other things](https://threejs.org/). 
    - Since WebGL is completely browser based, it also runs on most of the new smart phones. 
     
* What is Three.js ?
    - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is high-level JavaScript 
    - library making it even easier to work with WebGL. With it, it's possible to easily create complex, interactive 3D computer animations, without worrying about WebGL details. 
    
* What do we learn in this course ?
    - By the end we have learned how to create a 3D program that runs in the web browser, while also understanding the basic principles of how computer images are generated.
