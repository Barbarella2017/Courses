#### 28 Introduction to WebGL and GPU rendering with Three.js **Patrick FÃ¼rst**


* Why learn [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) ?
    - Thanks to WebGL, the technology for 3D programs is made widely available in the web browser. This new technology let's us create new immersive user experiences through [3D games](http://kiddisco.asmallgame.com/), [interactive videos](http://www.ro.me/) and much [more](https://threejs.org/).
    - Since WebGL is completely browser based, it also runs on most of the new smartphones.

* What is Three.js ?
    - [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a high-level JavaScript library that makes it even easier to work with WebGL. It allows you to create complex, interactive 3D computer animations with ease, without having to worry about any WebGL details.

* What do we learn in this course ?
    - By the end of the course, you will be able to create a 3D program that runs in the web browser and you will have gained an understanding of the basic principles of how computer images are generated.
