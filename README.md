### Stage 2: Clearifying Proposals
A Proposal got to have the following features: 
1) A Headline that contains a viable and understandable Summary of the courses content. 
2) A 3-4 sencence description that explains the startingpoint, requirements, scope (hours), preparations if necessary  and other relevant details
3) One or several Authors that hold the course: Name, Twitterhandle and links to relevant resources
4) A Link for registration

### Stage 3: Presentation Phase: 
The Proposals will then be presented to members. It is the interest of DI to give best visiblity to all of its available courses. 
Authors might be approached with questions or requests with regards to course marketing

### Stage 4: Sign-Up Phase
Members are able to signal their interest and once the threshold of 12 Attendents is met the course shall be conducted in the next weeks. 

### Stage 5: Course Phase
The Course is held in an approporate location, typically "the Muttershiff", the "OpenLab im Leuchtturm" or something similar

### Stage 6: Project Phase
